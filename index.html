  <h2>About Me</h2>
   <p>Hi there, first let me introduce myself, my name is Andy Nguyen and im 23 years old and im currently enrolled in a 6 month bootcamp course in the field of software engineering to broaden my knowledge. I believe it is possible for myself to gain further working experience in this field as i am dedicated and open-minded to trying new things by gaining experience and knowledge. By undertaking this course, i aim to broaden my professional and coding skills by learning new things throughout the next cpuple of months. At the end of my course, i hope to discover job opportunties within a fast paced and co-operative working environment.I cannot wait for what this course has to offer myself and how i could potentially be an imperative asset for firms. Now, let me tell you a bit about myself. Whilst i have recently started on this journey of software engineering, i have discovered along the way that having a healthy lifestyle aligns with a healthy mindset. This has then motivated me to begin taking better care of myself and the first step has been to join a gym to stay active and healthy. I am also motivated to adopt a healthier diet and drinking plenty of water throughout the day. Thus, my overall goal is to become healthier and adopt healthier habits to allow myself to attain the best mind set possible.  </p>
